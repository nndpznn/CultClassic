## TODO:
- TRAINING: Create scripts to train the model on real data, cost/loss function, adjusting weights, etc.
- EVALUATION: Create scripts to "use" the model on new data and present accuracy statistics. RMSE, NDCG, Precision@k, Recall@k? 
- OUTPUT: For output later - find a way to map movie IDs to movie names so that the output movies actually make sense.
